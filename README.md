This is a simple Snake game that I have created with PyGame - one of the well-known libraries of Python. The game is not finished yet; I will be updating it regularly. I'm currently learning Data Structures and Algorithms; when I'm done with them, I'm going to implement some of those data structure in my game.

To start the game, please run the snake_game.py file.
